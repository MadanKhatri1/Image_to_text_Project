# Image Captioning with Transformers
This project implements a Streamlit web application for generating captions for uploaded images using a pre-trained transformer model.

Features
  1. Upload an image (.jpg, .jpeg, or .png)
  
  2. Generate captions using a pre-trained image captioning model
  
  3. Display the uploaded image and generated caption


# Setup the project
  1. Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/MadanKhatri1/Image_to_text_Project](https://github.com/MadanKhatri1/Image_to_text_Project.git)
  2. CD to the Image to text project.
  3. Run: **pip install -r requirements.txt**
  4. Then type: **streamlit run project.py**



# How it works:

The application utilizes pre-trained deep learning models from the Transformers library to understand and describe visual content. Here's a simplified breakdown:

  Transformers: These are state-of-the-art models trained on massive datasets of images and text. They can learn the relationships between visual features and corresponding descriptions.
  Streamlit: This framework makes it easy to create web apps in Python. It provides components for user interaction and displaying information.
  Using the App:

Open the application in your web browser.
  1. Click "Choose an image..." and select an image from your computer.
  2. Click "Upload".
     
The app will process the image and generate a caption.

You'll see the uploaded image alongside the generated caption.

This application is a great example of how artificial intelligence can be used for creative tasks like image captioning.
